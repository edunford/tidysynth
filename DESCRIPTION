Description: A synthetic control offers a way of evaluating the effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. The package makes a number of improvements when implementing the method in R. These improvements allow users to inspect, visualize, and tune the synthetic control more easily. A key benefit of a tidy implementation is that the entire preparation process for building the synthetic control can be accomplished in a single pipe. For more information on the synthetic control method, see Abadie et al. (2003) <doi:10.1257/000282803321455188>.
