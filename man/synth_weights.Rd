\arguments{
\item{data}{nested data of type \code{synth_tbl} generated from
\code{sythetic_control()}. See \code{synthetic_control()} documentation for more
information. In addition, a matrix of predictors must be pre-specified
using the \code{generate_predictor()} function. See documentation for more
information on how to generate a predictor function.}

\item{time_window}{the temporal window of the pre-intervention outcome time
series to be used in the optimization task. Default behavior uses the
entire pre-intervention time period.}

\item{custom_variable_weights}{a vector of provided weights that define a
variable's importance in the optimization task. The weights are intended to
reflect the users prior regarding the relative significance of each
variable. Vector must sum to one. Note that the method is significantly
faster when a custom variable weights are provided. Default behavior
assumes no wieghts are provided and thus must be learned from the data.}

\item{include_fit}{Boolean flag, if TRUE, then the optimization output is
included in the outputted \code{tbl_df}.}

\item{optimization_method}{string vector that specifies the optimization
algorithms to be used. Permissable values are all optimization algorithms
that are currently implemented in the optimx function (see this function
for details). This list currently includes c("Nelder-Mead', 'BFGS', 'CG',
'L-BFGS-B', 'nlm', 'nlminb', 'spg', and 'ucminf"). If multiple algorithms
are specified, synth will run the optimization with all chosen algorithms
and then return the result for the best performing method. Default is
"BFGS". As an additional possibility, the user can also specify 'All' which
means that synth will run the results over all algorithms in optimx.}

\item{genoud}{Logical flag. If true, synth embarks on a two step
optimization. In the first step, genoud, an optimization function that
combines evolutionary algorithm methods with a derivative-based
(quasi-Newton) method to solve difficult optimization problems, is used to
obtain a solution. See genoud for details. In the second step, the genoud
results are passed to the optimization algorithm(s) chosen in optimxmethod
for a local optimization within the neighborhood of the genoud solution.
This two step optimization procedure will require much more computing time,
but may yield lower loss in cases where the search space is highly
irregular.}

\item{quadopt}{string vector that specifies the routine for quadratic
optimization over w weights. possible values are "ipop" and "LowRankQP"
(see ipop and LowRankQP for details). default is 'ipop'}

\item{Margin.ipop}{setting for ipop optimization routine: how close we get to
the constraints (see ipop for details)}

\item{Sigf.ipop}{setting for ipop optimization routine: Precision (default: 7
significant figures (see ipop for details)}

\item{Bound.ipop}{setting for ipop optimization routine: Clipping bound for
the variables (see ipop for details)}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag. If TRUE then intermediate results will be shown.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to optimx and or genoud to
adjust optimization.}

\description{
Auxiliary Function for generating individual weights for each unit-specific
data entry. The method allows of opimtizing weights for all placebo and
treated data configurations (assuming there are placebo configurations to
generate)
